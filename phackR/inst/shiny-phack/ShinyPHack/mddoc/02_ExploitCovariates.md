### Exploiting Covariates

This p-hacking strategy exploits the common practice of controlling for covariates in statistical analyses. Here, we assume that a researcher is interested in an independent samples t-test. If this test does not yield a significant result, the researcher introduces a number of continuous covariates into the analysis (which will then be computed as an ANCOVA). We assume that all covariates are first entered into the analysis individually, and if this does not yield a significant result, they are added sequentially as y ~ x + cov1, y ~ x + cov1 + cov2, ... (in decreasing order of correlation with the dependent variable).

The simulation function in this Shiny app allows the specification of the number of covariates, as well as their correlation. Users can also specify whether the ANCOVA models should include interaction terms. Note that the inclusion of interaction terms will slow down the computation considerably. Other options users can specify are the number of observations per group, the p-value selection method, the significance level &alpha;, and the number of simulation iterations.
