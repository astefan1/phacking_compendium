### Discretizing variables

This p-hacking strategy is based on splitting a continuous variable into categories with regard to two or more arbitrary cutoff values. Here, we assume that at the start a researcher plans to conduct a univariate linear regression. If this analysis does not yield a significant result, the researcher discretizes the independent variable and compares the means of the resulting groups in the dependent variable. We simulate three approaches: (1) Compare high-scorers and low-scorers based on a median split; (2) conduct a three-way split of the independent variable and compare the two extreme groups; (3) conduct a three-way split of the independent variables and compare all three groups using an ANOVA.

The simulation function in this Shiny app allows the specification of the sample size, as well as of the p-value selection method, the significance level &alpha;, and the number of iterations in the simulation.
